## `.gitignore`

When starting a new project in RStudio, it will always add a file `.gitignore` if it does not already exists (you can actually create one in the online setup) and add some initial files to ignore. A `.gitignore` file enlists all those files that should not be taken into account by Git (not part of the snapshot). An example is the `.Rhistory` file, as this file will save your temporary tests, variables, etc.

Hence, we can ignore the `.Rhistory` file by adding the file to the `.gitignore` text-file. We can do this inside Rstudio.

> 2. Right click on `.Rhistory` and select `Ignore...`
> 3. Check if the content of `.gitignore` is correctly updated and click `Save`.

The website [https://www.gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) from TopTal can help you figure out what files to ignore, look at the [R example](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/r) `.gitignore`.

Some other examples of files you probably want to ignore:
- Sensitive information (passwords,...)!
- Binary files. Git works very will with **text** files (any type of text), but not with binary files such as `.Rdata`.
- Files > 50MB. Git is specifically made for **code** (e.g. `.R`) and does not intend to track all changes in large data files.
- A _temp/_ folder inside your project with 'disposable' content, e.g. `draft`, `test` or `temp`. Sometimes such a subfolder is convenient, but should not contain anything crucial for your project.
- In any programming language, some files are _derivatives_

> ## Ignore all files inside a folder
>
> 1. Create a folder `plots/` and add an image to the folder.
> 2. Right click on `plots/` and select `Ignore...`
> 3. Check if the content of `.gitignore` is correctly updated and click `Save`.

> ## Use wildcards to ignore multiple files
> 
> Note that you can use wild cards e.g. `*.Rproj` to exclude a group of files from the version control.
