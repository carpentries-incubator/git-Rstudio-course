## The story of your project

One of the advantages of using version control with regular and properly defined commits is that you get a history of your project. You can check the history (the series of commits) both online on GitHub as well as in Rstudio.

In Rstudio, click on `history` in the Git pane:

![View history]({{ page.root }}/fig/history-rstudio1.png)

> ## Git history versus command history
>
> Notice the presence of `History` twice in the following image: 
>    - As a separate pane (your R command history): this has nothing to do with Git
>    - Within the `Git` pane (the history of your commit messages)
{: .callout}

You can click on each of the commits to verify the adaptations that were part of the specific commit:

![View history commits changes]({{ page.root }}/fig/history-rstudio2.png)

> ## Check project history online
> 
> 1. On the webpage of your repository, check the commit history by clicking the `commits` tab.
> 1. Why is this different to the local history?
