# Git using Rstudio

Researchers working with R do write code and benefit from using version control. As `git` is not the most straightforward environment to work with for non-IT specialists, this lesson provides a first introduction to `git` inside the Rstudio environment. 

This lesson has been setup initially as part of the [carpentry workshop](https://inbo.github.io/2018-06-12-bru-datacarpentry-inbo-elixir/) June 12-13, 2018 in Brussels.
